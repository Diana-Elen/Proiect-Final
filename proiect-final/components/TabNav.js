                Beauty and magic. The simple kind that is all around, of which we fail to see.  As long as I can remember, I have spent my time seeking it and wanting to create my own.  To share my passion and striving to always leave things better than I find them.  
                When people ask me, "What do you do for a living?",  "Flowers"  I say, smiling ear to ear.  The same smile I had as a child when my mother sent me to the garden for vegetables, watching my grandmother tend to her flowers, my father to the farm. Hands in the soil, one with the earth.
